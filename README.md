# Cleaning Data

This project has only the one file:

`run_analysis.R`

This file is to be put outside the folder `UCI HAR Dataset` and run in this directory. So if the directory structure is as follows:

```bash
"projectFolder\run_analysis.R"
"projectFolder\UCI HAR Dataset\features.txt"
```
etc...,

the file should be run in the `projectFolder` directory.

It should produce the two files:

`summary.csv`, and `total.csv`.

The file `CodeBook.md` provides the inference for the data being created, all of the variables within the `run_analysis.R` file and a short algorithm for the program.
